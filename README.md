**CoinTrek** is a geolocation-based simulation inspired by games like Pok√©mon Go. Players explore a digital map, moving between locations to collect coins at geocached stops by either using the arrow buttons or moving physically. You can click on the lit up blue squares on the map to collect the coins. You can also deposit said coins to any of the blue squares to keep them in a central location.

Built with `TypeScript`, `Vite`, and `Leaflet.js`, this project showcases how real-world coordinates can be used for interactive, location-based gameplay in the browser.
